# FIXME: There's a bug here. If rule is say /menus/5/delete and access is called
#        for a role that doesnt have a rule -> convert to /menus/ ->
#        call lookup("/menus/", role_id) -> lookup returns None
#        but when lookup = None then there rule is tried again without converting
#        call lookup("/menus/5/delete") -> Exception as /menus/5/delete has indeed
#        no entry ...
