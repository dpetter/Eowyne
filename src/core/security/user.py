# User
#
# Users have a (display) name, an email and a password.
# Every user has a role that defines his permissions.
# This module also provides two filter classes. For security reasons "User"
# should never be used outside of administrative pages. For displaying information
# about the creator of a page, comment, etc. use the filter class "Editor".
# The filter class "Client" is part of the global scope and holds all information
# about the user making the request that is currently processed, such as
# his role and his name.
